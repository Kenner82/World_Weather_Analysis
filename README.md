# World Weather Analysis

## Project Overview

Using API calls to OpenWeatherMap and 2,000 random latitude and longitude pairs, weather data (including maximum temperature, humidity, cloudiness, wind speed, and current weather description) was gathered for the cities nearest to each set of coordinates. These cities are able to be filtered by inputting the maximium and minimum temperature criteria for a vacation itinerary. API calls to Google Maps were used to find the nearest hotel to each city within the filtered range, and then displayed on a Google Map with pop-up markers for each location. Four nearby cities on the map are used to demonstarte the Google Directions API by planning a round trip visit to see all of the cities, and then the data for each hotel and the current weather there is displayed on a map.
